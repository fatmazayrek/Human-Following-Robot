# Human-Following-Robot: 
I gave this robot the ability to follow people by using its IR and Ultrasonic sensors on Arduino. In addition, by adding a certain control mechanism to the code, I also ensured that the vehicle accelerates as soon as the person moves away. I clearly wrote the inputs and outputs of all these features and sensors in the code.

I hope it will guide you in your projects.

Good work
